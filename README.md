# Iris Flower Classification

## Introduction
Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning project that involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset contains 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using this data, various classification algorithms can be applied to predict the species of an iris flower. This project demonstrates essential concepts in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (target variable)

The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
    cd iris-flower-classification
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Iris_Classification.ipynb
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python iris_classification.py
    ```

## Models
The project includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization of the results is provided through confusion matrices and other plots to help understand the model performance.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixes.
